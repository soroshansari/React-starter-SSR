This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Run all tests using jest.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run test:update`

Update all Jest snapshots (if there are any)

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Run plop to create new React components or Redux reducers via CLI

### Import SVGs as ReactComponent

You can import SVG files as React components exactly the way you can do it in Create React App 2.0:

```
import { ReactComponent as Logo } from './Logo.svg';
```

Then you can use it in JSX like `<div><Logo /></div>`.

[Here is a video](https://egghead.io/lessons/react-add-svgs-as-react-components-with-create-react-app-2-0) that explains that a bit more.
